# Machine_Learning
This repository contains various machine learning projects and examples, starting with simple regression models and eventually including more advanced techniques such as neural networks.
More to come in the near future

## Projects

### 1. Simple Regression
This project demonstrates a simple linear regression model to determine CO2 emissions based on a single vehicle features.

#### Files
- `simple_regression.py`: Contains the code for loading data, preprocessing, building, and evaluating a simple linear regression model.

- ### Future Projects

- Multiple Regression
- Neural Networks
- Classification Models
- Clustering Algorithms
- And more...

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Required Python packages (listed in `requirements.txt`)
